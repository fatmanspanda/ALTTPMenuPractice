		<h2>Gameplay</h2>
		<p>
			The goal of Menu Simulator is to improve your Link to the Past menuing skills by
			training your brain to find the optimal path between two items and
			training your hands to execute it as quickly as possible.
		</p>
		<p>
			Items are randomly chosen to be placed on the menu, with some items
			(e.g., bombs and bottles), appearing more often,
			simply because there are more chances to find them when actually playing.
		</p>
		<p>
			Your current selection is indicated with a green circle,
			and your target is indicated with two red rings.
		</p>
		<p>
			To confirm your selection, press <tt>Start</tt>.
		</p>
		<hr />
		<h2>Game modes</h2>
		<h3>Study</h3>
		<p>
			In Study, you are given a brief period of time to study the layout of the menu before playing a round.
		</p>
		<h3>Blitz</h3>
		<p>
			In Blitz, the layout of the menu changes every time.
		</p>
		<h3>Collections</h3>
		<p>
			In Collections, you start with 4 random items and gain more as the round increases.
			It's like playing randomizer, but without all the boring stuff. Just good ol' menuing.
		</p>
		<hr />

		<h2>Scoring</h2>
		<p>
			After every round, you will receive a score to judge your performance based on the following factors:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Difficulty setting</li>
			<li>The number of moves you made</li>
			<li>How long it took you</li>
			<li>A bonus for having an optimal path</li>
			<li>A penalty for pressing <tt>Start</tt> on the wrong item</li>
		</ul>
		<br />
		<p>
			All of your scores and moves are stored for later viewing.
			To see what you did on a specific turn,
			select the column in the table and click the "Recap" button.
			This will open a new dialog with the following additional information:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>A snapshot of the original item layout, including the starting point and goal.</li>
			<li>The optimal path found by the computer.</li>
			<li>The path you took, indicated with hollow, blue arrows.</li>
			<li>Any slot you pressed <tt>Start</tt> on, indicated with two blue rings.</li>
		</ul>
		<br />
		<p>
			When looking for an optimal path, the algorithm will score each valid path
			and score them based on the number of consecutive inputs.
			<br />
			For example, a path that moves ▲◀▼
			will recieve a lower score than a path that moves ▶▶▶.
